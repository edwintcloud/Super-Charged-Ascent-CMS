This read me is designed to assist you in setting up webam.
All of the changes you need to make are included in one configuration file, this should make set-up easy.

Open the /defs/config.php file in any text editor
(I recommend PSPAD, it is a very nice document editing program, free. simply google if you would like to try it)

1. *mysql* 
you need to input the data necessary to connect to your database(db).
Also specify the name of your specific db's where required.
In cases of using only 2 db's, simply define the extra config to the db where those files are located.
ex. (you have your characters and accounts in one db, point both defines to that db)

2. *game server*
set the info requested here. 
$server will almost always be localhost, unless you are running webam remotely from the actual game server
remember to input the proper port.

3. *account creation*
here you can enable or disable the options by changin true/false

4. *date/time*
input your local timezones three letter code

5. *externals*
you can name your header title under the $custom setting
make sure links point to web addresses, if external
further instructions for setting these are in the config file

6. *layout*
the title setting is the description of the page that appears in the tab
you can also adjust how many 'items' to display one a single page

7. *mail*
this tut assumes you have a mailer set-up, as I don't know enough about them to help you there.
this section is self explanatory, just input your info.

8. *backup*
you shouldn't need to edit anything here, but if you do, just follow the examples already present.

9. *debug*
nothing required here


Now that we have all our configurations set, save and close the file.

Find the SQL folder and execute the motd.sql into your account db, it must be account db to function correctly.

To display online gm's, they must be set in the accounts table of your account database.
